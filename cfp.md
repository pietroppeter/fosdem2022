# Call for participation - Nim at FOSDEM22
Nim has participated at FOSDEM for a number of years now. In the beginning as a
stand, then as multiple talks across various rooms, and in organising the room
"Minimalistic, Experimental and Emerging Languages devroom" along with other
communites. This year however we are happy to announce that we have our own
developer room!

## What is FOSDEM?
FOSDEM is the "Free and Open Source Developers European Meetup". It is an annual
meeting place for developers of free and open source software from across all of
the world, hosted normally in Brussels in Belgium. The event itself is a massive
conference spanning two days with thousands of visitors and hundreds of talks on
various topics. This year, as last year, the conference will be completely
digital.

## Call for Participation
Since we now have our own room to fill we invite our great community to submit
their talks. Since the event is digital all presentations will be pre-recorded,
but you are required to be present during your presentation and for some time
after to answer any questions. This is similar to how we've run NimConf for the
past two years so we have no doubt that this will work very well and that we'll
have the same excellent level of quality that we've come to expect from you!

All submissions have to be made through the [FOSDEM
pentabarf](https://penta.fosdem.org/) system, and make sure to select "Nim
Programming Language" when submitting (otherwise we won't find it).

### What are we looking for?
Pretty much anything related to Nim! From compiler development to projects
written in it, to more generalised topics around Nim and the community.
Inspiration can of course be found in this list of previous FOSDEM talks, along
with our [NimConf
