So under this list, the responsibilities are as follows:

* Video Reviewer - The person who is expected to review the video.
* Host - The person that will moderate the live session, hosting the Q&A and moderating the chat.

In terms of FOSDEM's roles this means we will all still be "coordinators" of every talk (which should give us all the ability to moderate at any time in case it's needed).
The "host" role was added for each person that is hosting each talk.
